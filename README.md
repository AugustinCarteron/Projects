Dear Reader,

Welcome to my GitHub Project Repository. I am a third year student at Sorbonne Universit√© (Paris, France) studying Mechanical Engineering.

Being a musician, I am heavily interested in the field of acoustics. Therefore, you will find couple of projects that I have done during my studies that tackle this domain of physics. 

If you are willing to contact me, please feel free to send an email : Augustin.Carteron@etu.sorbonne-universite.fr
